## Joshua Azemoh's personal website

Joshua Azemoh is pretty cool guy, cooler than most. But he doesn't have a website, so he had to build one.

#### The repo for Joshua Azemoh's personal site.

1. Run `npm install` on a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run `gulp` and it'll run the server.
3. Go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
4. Might as well kick back on the [Browser-sync extension](http://browsersync.io)
