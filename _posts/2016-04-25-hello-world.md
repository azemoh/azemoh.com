Hello World! and welcome to my blog where I will be writing about the things I learn and problems I encounter in my exciting journey as a Software Developer. I am always looking to learn new thing and to better understand the things I already know (I think in know :-p), so by sharing things I learn, I hope gain a better understanding of them and hopefully help someone else do the same.

I've always wanted to do this for sometime but I kept putting it off. That is because I use to think running a blog would be a huge commitment and that it would take time away from doing what I enjoy the most, which is well writing code. I have come to realize that that is not true, and that trying to express and idea in some form, is an good way to better understand it. Someone said "a great way to understand a concept or an idea is to try to articulate or explain it to someone else".

That is what I intend to achieve with this blog; I want it to serve as a medium of expression and a point of reference for me and for anyone reading, I hope that you learn something new, help you solve a problem or at least help you think about it in a different way.
