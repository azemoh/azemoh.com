After continually letting different writing ideas fall to the wayside week after week, I have buckled down and decided to do something about it.

<!--more-->

My main excuse was... well, I just plain didn't have anywhere that I can continually write on.

Second excuse, I haven't invested the time into sitting down and completely creating my own blog from scratch. In the spirit of just wanting to write, I have spun up and slightly customized a Ghost blog with a theme that someone else created.

It feels slightly wrong to have not made my site myself, but it feels pretty right to have a home for my articles. So, no more excuses.
